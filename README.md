# Coursera's Data Science Specialization
This repository contains all the assignments done as part of the Data Science Specialization, offered by the John Hopkins University on Coursera

### Important Note
The code in these assignments represent my first steps on coding in general. The assignments were done before completing my BSc. in Statistics, 
as part of my endeavour to pursue a carreer in Data Science. As such, both the coding and the deductions are on a completely novice level and should be criticised with that in mind.
### Information
**All assignments were completed in R.** <br>
The Reproducible Research folder contains Markdown and HTML, apart from R.

The included courses, so far, are:
- Getting and Cleaning Data
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Reproducible Research
