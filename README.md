# Coursera-DataScienceSpecialization
This repository contains all the assignments done as part of the Data Science Specialization, offered by the John Hopkins University on Coursera

**All assignments were completed in R.**

The included courses, so far, are:
- Getting and Cleaning Data
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Reproducible Research

**Important Note:** The code in these assignments represent my first steps on coding in general. The assignments were done before completing my BSc. in Statistics, 
as part of my endeavour to pursue a carreer in Data Science. As such, the coding is on a completely novice level and should be criticised with that in mind.
